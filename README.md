A Javascript game within a game
By
Guzm√°n Eguiagaray

A catch-em-all game and typing game combined:
Use the arrows to pursue a pedestrian
Once you stop them, type the letters to get points  

## 01 Animation
The pedestrians walk a set path and the player can only talk to each pedestrian once

## 02 2d top-down level
openGameArt.org assets and tilesets. An original level with layers (out-of-bounds, foreground) with Tiled program

## 03 Guess the letter
When the program detects a collision, the second game is triggered. Event listener controls for one key input and sets off animations
